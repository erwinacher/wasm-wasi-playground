## ideas for some development
 
- [ ] client side wasm module using C++23 (maybe a game)
- [ ] client side wasm module using Rust (maybe a game)
- [ ] client side wasm module with an embedded LLM engine written in C or Rust
- [ ] server side wasm/wasi module using C++23 with wasmer or wasmtime 
- [ ] server side wasm/wasi module using Rust with wasmer or wasmtime and axum
- [ ] modern C++23 modular code implementation test
- [ ] build.rs build pipeline
- [ ] server side LLM (llamacpp or candle) with multiple client serving also using wasm/wasi
- [ ] make the two wasm modules on the client and on the server communicate with each other using a binary protocol
- [ ] load and run perf tests
- [ ] TBC
