## ideas for some development
 
- [] client side wasm module using c++23 (maybe a game)
- [] client side wasm module using rust (maybe a game)
- [] client side wasm module with an embedded LLM engine
- [] server side wasm/wasi module using c++23 with wasmer or wasmtime 
- [] server side wasm/wasi module using rust with wasmer or wasmtime and axum
- [] modern C++23 modular code implementation test
- [] build.rs build pipeline
- [] server side LLM (llamacpp or candle) with multiple client serving also using wasm/wasi
- [] make the two wasm modules on the client and on the server communicate using a binary protocol
- [] TBC
